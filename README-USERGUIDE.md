# COSC455_Compiler

In order to run this java jar application you need to go to the command line. 

You will need to change directories to where you have the jar file stored. Make sure that the test file is also inside that directory. 

Type the following into the command line: 

java -jar Compiler455.jar filename.mkd

Hit enter. 

If the file is able to be compiled by the compiler, Google Chrome will load the HTML Markdown language automatically.
